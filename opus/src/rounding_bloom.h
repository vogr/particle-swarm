/*
 * This file defines a Bloom filter that can be used to test the proximity of 
 * points in our problem space.
 * It works by binning the points in a grid of edge size epsilon. The coordinates
 * of the bin is a vector of integers that can be tested for inclusion in a bloom
 * filter.
 * 
 *      (bin_id)_k := floor(v_k / eps)
 * 
 * Using this simple approach would yield errors for points close together but
 * separated by an edge, e.g. in 1D with epsilon=1.0 for 2.95 and 3.05. They
 * would end up in separate bins.
 * 
 * Instead, we can look for the presence of points in all the neighboring bins,
 * e.g. for point 2.95, look at bin 1, 2 and 3.
 * 
 * As an optimization, we can restrict ourselves to checking only 2^d bins by looking
 * at the position of the point in the dual grid (i.e. the grid shifted by eps)
 * 
 *      (dual_bin_id)_k := floor( v_k / eps - 1. / 2)
 * 
 * In 1D:
 *    
 *    Grid:
 *
 *   -1       0       1       2       3       4
 *    |-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
 *    
 *    Dual grid
 *       -1       0       1       2       3       4
 *    ----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
 *
 *                                   ^
 *                                   | 
 *                                   ---- 2.95
 * 
 *     For x=(2.95), bin_id=2 and dual_bin_id=3
 *    
 * The bloom filter is checked for the presence of points in (dual_bin_id-1) or dual_bin_id-1,
 * if the check comes back negative, bin_id is added to the bloom filter.
 * (A true collision implies d(x,y) <= sqrt(d * (3/2 esp)^2) )
 * Note: this implies 2^d bloom filter checks ! To decrease the complexity, it's possible to only
 * check only at bin_id (but then close points separated by a grid edge will not be found).
 * 
 * To make the bin_id space larger, the points are translated by -lower_bound (lower limit of
 * the bounding box) to be saved as uint64_t.
